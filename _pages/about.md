I'm Sidharth Shyamsukha, a highly motivated and skilled computer engineer. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from New York University, where I focused on Internet Architecture, Machine Learning, and Datacenter & Cloud Computing. My Bachelor's degree in Information Technology is from Nirma University.

I have a diverse skill set, including front-end development with HTML, CSS, and React, database management using Hadoop and Spark, and proficiency in languages like C++, Python, and Java. I'm experienced in deploying applications with tools like Docker and AWS.

In my role as a Student Researcher at NYU, I led a team of 30 students, implementing agile frameworks and optimizing development processes. I contributed to a streamlined workflow by deploying corelink clients and integrating documentation API into CI/CD<a href="https://vip.hsrn.nyu.edu">.

During my internship at Crest Data Systems, I enhanced the Human Resource Management System, improving efficiency by adding features, reducing load time, and fixing bugs related to employee designations.

At Vehere Interactive Pvt. Ltd, I developed an application to detect and prevent website leaks, successfully preventing over 500 incidents and securing a new client.

I've completed notable projects, including optimizing deepfake detection using GANs, implementing backdoor defenses with GPT3, and proposing a blockchain-based consensus protocol for fair transaction ordering.

With a strong drive for continuous learning and a passion for technology, I am an adaptable team player with strong communication skills. My academic achievements and practical experience make me a valuable asset to any organization.
