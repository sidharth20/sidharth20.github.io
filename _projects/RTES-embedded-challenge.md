title: "Gyroscope Gesture based Locking Mechanism using Embedded Compute Unit"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/RTES-embedded-challenge
excerpt: '- Used the STM32F429 Discovery board to make a gesture based locking mechanism.

- Recorded 1 gesture movement. The board automatically starts recording values once there is a movement in any one of the axis, the user does not have to press any button to start or stop recording.

- The saved gesture becomes the base gesture, and every gesture that is performed after that is compared with this base gesture using L2 norm. And using this normalized data to make decision whether the entered gesture matches the saved gesture and how close the match is.'
