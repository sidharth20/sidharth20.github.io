title: "Stealthy Syntactical Backdoor Attack on BERT and LSTM"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/stealthy-syntactic-backdoor-attacks
excerpt: '- Inserting Stealthy Syntactic Backdoors which are not perceivable by the Humans during Input checks and audits

- Using T5 Model along with SCPN to generate paraphrased sentences with minor syntactic changes so as to trigger backdoor only when inputs with these given syntactic rule are passed.

- Resulted in increased ASR (Attack success rate) to 96.73% for given stealthy syntactical attacks
